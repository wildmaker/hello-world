# hello-world

hi there!

I started my tech program two month ago,but the "procrastination" wasted most of the time.

now,i am back to my feet again,i will persist,even recognizing that i will restart not just once.

i built the hello-world repository to record what i am doing,or have done,or my idea, my thought in the way to achieve it.

someday,something beautiful will shine,i hope it comes from the unlimited cosmos.

i do love cosmos.
