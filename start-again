For the reason of "more money" and “career continuity”, I made a decision to switch my job working as a  "product manager" in a different company in october. Now, to some extent, i think it's a bad idea, which has been made from indulgent desire for money and cowardice to the unknown challenge.

"Instead of giving up the goal to adapt to the obstacle, you should just stick to your goals". l learned it from the new job this year. I decide to give up the “PM” career and restart to learning coding to become a "engineer".
